The Soft Party API it's a project that I am development with the purpose of practice a lot concepts surround the backend development world.

To begin I will develop a server NodeJS/Express with a JWT authentication and a route to login, the user data will be saved in a PostgresSQL database and to conect and manage the database I will use Sequelize ORM.

Other rule that I try follow it's have at leats 80% of test coverage to this I will utilize Jest like test runner.

I also will utilize docker to improve the development experience and in a second moment I will try to run this API in a cloud ambient like AWS and with CI/CD deploy.
